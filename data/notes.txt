Gene expression
---------------
- filtered data from 3k PBMCs obtained from following the Scanpy tutorial
  https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html
	
- link to dataset:
  https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/pbmc3k
	
- after the filtering steps (up until highly variable genes) and transposing, the matrix is of shape 1838 x 2638 (n_genes x n_cells)



Hyperspectral

- subsetting of hyperspectral image
  The Moffett image is huge. We followed the "Joint Majorization-Minimization for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with
  the Î²-divergence" paper and extracted a 50x50 window from the middle of the image. Some bands have negative values. We
  exclueded them, reducing the number of bands from 224 to 189. This matches the size of the data used in the above paper.

  >>> import spectral   # https://github.com/spectralpython/spectral
  >>> moffett_hsi = spectral.io.envi.open("moffett.hdr", "moffett")
  >>> moffett_hsi.shape
  (1924, 753, 224)
  >>> window = moffett_hsi[962-25:962+25, 376-25:376+25, :]
  >>> window.shape
  (50, 50, 224)

- reshaping
  flattened 2500 pixels over 189 spectral bands
